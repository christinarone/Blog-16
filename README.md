How do you feel about your upcoming project? What do you anticipate while working with a classmate?
I feel nervous. Working with a classmate is a great thing for me especially when my partner knows so much about coding. 

What benefits will there be to work with someone else?
I like being paired off with someone who can guide me along the way and submit an awesome project.
